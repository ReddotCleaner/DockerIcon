1
00:00:14,581 --> 00:00:15,949
Pioneers have always been

2
00:00:15,949 --> 00:00:19,552
met with ridicule after Mr.

3
00:00:20,153 --> 00:00:22,655
Gentlemen, were scientists.

4
00:00:22,655 --> 00:00:25,058
As a month,
they tested observable phenomena.

5
00:00:25,225 --> 00:00:26,326
And let me see.

6
00:00:26,326 --> 00:00:29,996
Your thesis is that voices of the dead

7
00:00:30,263 --> 00:00:33,133
can be heard through the new London
Telephone network.

8
00:00:34,501 --> 00:00:35,535
Do I have that right, Mr.

9
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:37,103
Hay? Dr. Haig.

10
00:00:37,103 --> 00:00:41,274
But may I ask,
how many of these voices you

11
00:00:41,708 --> 00:00:44,944
yourself have discerned
through the static interference?

12
00:00:46,146 --> 00:00:49,149
No, Mummy not rung lately.

13
00:00:49,783 --> 00:00:52,318
We are not without sympathy for your loss.

14
00:00:52,585 --> 00:00:55,655
My own dear
mother passed away just a year ago.

15
00:00:56,022 --> 00:00:57,424
But even so,

16
00:00:57,424 --> 00:01:01,327
we are to officially inform you
that as of this moment,

17
00:01:01,327 --> 00:01:04,697
you are no longer a member of Her
Majesty's Royal Medical Society.

18
00:01:05,565 --> 00:01:14,240
Struck off.

19
00:01:15,008 --> 00:02:00,520
Wasn't that a telephone?

20
00:02:03,223 --> 00:02:39,726
I. Hello.

21
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:44,731
Very much so.

22
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:48,301
Patient.

23
00:02:48,301 --> 00:02:52,939
Who should grant me a little grace.

24
00:02:53,206 --> 00:02:56,242
Just a whisper.

25
00:02:56,643 --> 00:02:59,245
It's just a song.

26
00:02:59,979 --> 00:03:01,281
We always loved our songs.

27
00:04:29,535 --> 00:04:58,431
And have

28
00:05:07,874 --> 00:05:10,743
you rather

29
00:05:13,913 --> 00:05:14,414
them.

30
00:06:26,619 --> 00:06:31,090
Out? Why does Emily always get flowers.

31
00:06:34,227 --> 00:06:36,262
For. Murder?

32
00:06:36,262 --> 00:06:38,097
Still, the two of.

33
00:06:39,399 --> 00:06:40,400
Me, Kirby.

34
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,668
We are not common thieves.

35
00:06:43,336 --> 00:06:46,272
Are you sure it's even this place?

36
00:06:46,372 --> 00:06:48,508
So many pompous
fish on the side of the city.

37
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:50,510
Where else
are they going? To put someone like a.

38
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:52,445
Dump them in the river.

39
00:06:52,445 --> 00:06:54,580
I am gonna need some sleep.

40
00:06:55,181 --> 00:06:58,785
Sometimes when I'm digging these graves,
I think maybe I'm just annoyed

41
00:06:58,785 --> 00:07:00,186
in underneath the corpse.

42
00:07:00,186 --> 00:07:00,887
That's nice.

43
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:09,429
Tell me more.

44
00:07:09,529 --> 00:07:10,897
Finally

45
00:07:11,664 --> 00:07:12,498
got him.

46
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:18,271
Drilled straight through the bloody floor.

47
00:07:18,271 --> 00:07:20,807
That's how we see Melody.

48
00:07:20,807 --> 00:07:21,274
Okay.

49
00:07:21,274 --> 00:07:24,477
In front of all the fucking building
that cross shot

50
00:07:32,251 --> 00:07:32,685
right

51
00:07:35,288 --> 00:07:53,973
now. Can you direct you to the women's
barracks,

52
00:07:54,707 --> 00:08:40,653
or am I a little early for this room?

53
00:09:26,065 --> 00:09:28,634
There'll be an investigation.

54
00:09:28,634 --> 00:09:32,204
So you can't take anything.

55
00:09:36,275 --> 00:09:37,777
This is when

56
00:09:38,311 --> 00:09:39,745
the touched

57
00:09:40,112 --> 00:09:43,349
base is a revenge formality.

58
00:09:43,349 --> 00:09:45,117
No. They won't stop

59
00:09:45,117 --> 00:09:48,955
until they've shook
London into the ground.

60
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:51,057
She's got no one now.

61
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:51,958
And you.

62
00:09:52,858 --> 00:10:14,013
Do nothing.

63
00:10:14,013 --> 00:10:14,914
Right?

64
00:10:15,381 --> 00:10:19,719
I just.

65
00:10:21,053 --> 00:10:23,089
So we know the last place Mandy was seen

66
00:10:25,858 --> 00:10:27,226
around hanging.

67
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:29,195
We know she was dressed.

68
00:10:29,195 --> 00:10:31,631
As a female, also deceased.

69
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:34,500
According to your research.

70
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:38,838
I wager the colonel's still with us,
and we can offer a reward.

71
00:10:40,006 --> 00:10:48,414
Someone must have seen him on the streets.

72
00:10:48,414 --> 00:10:51,751
Fed while in mire or moaning
about our mismanagement of young men.

73
00:10:51,984 --> 00:10:54,020
Remind me it was the officer
in charge of that again.

74
00:10:54,020 --> 00:10:54,787
I'll just call him up.

75
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:57,089
Should I tell him you went along the wrong
bloody woman?

76
00:10:57,423 --> 00:10:59,625
She wasn't even. Touched. It's the truth.

77
00:10:59,625 --> 00:11:00,459
No one wants to hear it.

78
00:11:01,927 --> 00:11:03,529
The chance.

79
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:06,932
You know,
if you don't tell the public about melody.

80
00:11:06,932 --> 00:11:07,466
What are you going to do?

81
00:11:07,466 --> 00:11:10,336
Go down Fleet Street.

82
00:11:10,469 --> 00:11:13,973
You set one gelato in the direction
of those newspaper markets Monday.

83
00:11:14,507 --> 00:11:17,309
And I will personally make sure that
every last drop of this side of Hadrian's

84
00:11:17,309 --> 00:11:20,479
fucking wall knows
what kind of man you are.

85
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:22,682
The company you search out after dark.

86
00:11:23,749 --> 00:11:27,153
Or your gentleman friends.

87
00:11:28,487 --> 00:11:31,123
I like to do my research, you know.

88
00:11:31,123 --> 00:11:33,192
It's good to know you're working with.

89
00:11:33,192 --> 00:11:35,628
But there'll be no more special privileges
on my watch.

90
00:11:36,962 --> 00:11:39,031
You try and push through on this.

91
00:11:39,031 --> 00:11:41,067
Be five years hard
labor and public disgrace.

92
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:41,834
I don't think

93
00:11:41,834 --> 00:11:45,805
many people would be interested
in your little story, then, would I Not?

94
00:11:45,805 --> 00:11:47,173
The best place for your sort

95
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:51,343
prison. So

96
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:53,979
I'll just really do this.

97
00:11:53,979 --> 00:12:01,487
And I.

98
00:12:01,487 --> 00:12:03,856
Tightening of the touch detail. Yeah.

99
00:12:03,889 --> 00:12:04,790
And to be

100
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:09,528
well,

101
00:12:09,528 --> 00:12:23,843
go mine.

102
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,579
This is true.

103
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:27,780
Mr. Dan.

104
00:12:28,948 --> 00:12:29,949
You did it.

105
00:12:30,249 --> 00:12:31,283
But did it.

106
00:12:31,751 --> 00:12:33,619
How was the recon?

107
00:12:33,619 --> 00:12:35,521
Have no idea what we were doing there.

108
00:12:35,521 --> 00:12:37,623
But they've tripled in numbers
since yesterday.

109
00:12:38,090 --> 00:12:40,926
Grand is the same.

110
00:12:42,294 --> 00:12:43,229
It wasn't your fault.

111
00:12:43,229 --> 00:12:45,397
Melody didn't want to be saved.

112
00:12:45,397 --> 00:12:46,198
It was a grave error.

113
00:12:46,198 --> 00:12:46,565
Do you know?

114
00:12:46,565 --> 00:12:51,103
It just made me think of a soul
wandering through the streets of London

115
00:12:51,103 --> 00:12:52,204
for eternity.

116
00:12:52,204 --> 00:12:54,907
All those people just electrocuted.

117
00:12:55,174 --> 00:12:57,209
They did come to watch her hanged.

118
00:12:57,209 --> 00:12:58,711
Harriet said some of them brought picnics.

119
00:12:58,711 --> 00:12:59,411
But you would have thought

120
00:12:59,411 --> 00:13:01,947
that if anyone could have spotted
those powerlines, it should have been me.

121
00:13:02,414 --> 00:13:04,049
She ran them through here. Look.

122
00:13:04,049 --> 00:13:06,752
So obvious.

123
00:13:06,986 --> 00:13:09,722
Stop going over it.

124
00:13:12,525 --> 00:13:14,760
Is that how
you dealt with it when you were a soldier?

125
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,731
Well,
the death is just something going a bit.

126
00:13:20,132 --> 00:13:22,635
I had a job to do.

127
00:13:25,104 --> 00:13:27,807
Shall we make a start on our man?

128
00:13:27,807 --> 00:13:30,609
You're going to have that meeting first.

129
00:13:30,609 --> 00:13:34,246
You know the meeting where you tell
everyone about the future planting.

130
00:13:34,246 --> 00:13:34,680
What's actually.

131
00:13:34,680 --> 00:13:35,080
Going on?

132
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,649
There's no time limit.

133
00:13:36,649 --> 00:13:39,185
I've lived through this before, remember?

134
00:13:39,185 --> 00:13:40,820
Earthquakes are just the starting gun.

135
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:42,922
It's a matter of days
before the glenfinnan match.

136
00:13:42,922 --> 00:13:43,989
You have an hour to spare now.

137
00:13:43,989 --> 00:13:46,892
You have to be down there with it
when it happens in case

138
00:13:46,892 --> 00:13:49,662
it needs protection or transport or.

139
00:13:50,563 --> 00:13:52,565
I don't fucking know what it'll need.
A map.

140
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:53,032
The ship.

141
00:13:53,032 --> 00:13:55,401
Well, whatever it needs us, I can help.

142
00:13:55,401 --> 00:13:57,736
You owe them the truth.
We can't do this by committee.

143
00:13:57,903 --> 00:14:00,072
You know what
it'll be like hiding bloody cats.

144
00:14:00,072 --> 00:14:01,674
No one can agree on anything.

145
00:14:01,674 --> 00:14:02,208
I'm sorry.

146
00:14:02,208 --> 00:14:04,910
It's just so much easier to get on
with things when it's you and me.

147
00:14:04,944 --> 00:14:06,478
Oh, yeah? Yes.

148
00:14:06,478 --> 00:14:08,414
We have the body of that thing right here.

149
00:14:08,414 --> 00:14:11,150
It could be the
answer to who's down there.

150
00:14:13,853 --> 00:14:14,854
Come on, then.

151
00:14:14,954 --> 00:14:16,889
Let's make that start.

152
00:14:16,889 --> 00:14:31,904
Thank you.

153
00:14:31,904 --> 00:14:35,107
Amal is the spirit of a soldier from
the future in the body of a drowned baker.

154
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:37,309
And she's come here
to tell you all about an alien. Underland.

155
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:41,881
And who gave you all your magical powers?

156
00:14:41,881 --> 00:14:42,448
Got you.

157
00:14:42,448 --> 00:14:53,125
After a bit of a start, right.

158
00:14:54,393 --> 00:14:56,161
Came out of that cave with a clear mission

159
00:14:56,161 --> 00:14:58,697
to help the LNP and be ready to defend it.

160
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,000
Well, thank you for your time.

161
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:02,401
Penance and I have some ideas.

162
00:15:02,401 --> 00:15:04,069
What did it tell you?

163
00:15:04,837 --> 00:15:06,605
GALANTI Don't really speak well.

164
00:15:06,605 --> 00:15:08,641
I show you things in your mind.

165
00:15:09,041 --> 00:15:10,976
Okay,
so what things did this one show you?

166
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:12,211
Just fragments.

167
00:15:12,211 --> 00:15:13,345
Nothing coherent.

168
00:15:13,345 --> 00:15:15,314
I thought it sang Mary song.

169
00:15:15,314 --> 00:15:16,782
That's what Michael translated.

170
00:15:16,782 --> 00:15:18,450
So if I've got this right,

171
00:15:18,450 --> 00:15:22,121
the Galaxy uses its psychic tentacles
to suck out your brain.

172
00:15:22,254 --> 00:15:23,589
Not that kind of alien.

173
00:15:23,589 --> 00:15:25,891
Can you prove it from the future?
How would I do that?

174
00:15:26,058 --> 00:15:29,762
You could tell us what's gonna happen
tomorrow, next week.

175
00:15:30,062 --> 00:15:32,598
The queen dies quite soon.

176
00:15:32,598 --> 00:15:34,133
I don't have my formal debut regret.

177
00:15:34,133 --> 00:15:35,067
It doesn't die.

178
00:15:35,067 --> 00:15:36,869
I mean, does die. Everyone die.

179
00:15:36,869 --> 00:15:39,471
But you didn't, apparently.
So what's the plan?

180
00:15:39,605 --> 00:15:41,373
I mean, I know
there must be a plan, right?

181
00:15:41,373 --> 00:15:42,574
This is the thing you just had us.

182
00:15:43,776 --> 00:15:44,310
Look,

183
00:15:44,310 --> 00:15:47,179
yesterday we went down to the cave,
some of us, anyway.

184
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:49,248
And it was a shit show.

185
00:15:49,815 --> 00:15:52,584
I only just escaped those human robot
things.

186
00:15:52,618 --> 00:15:53,519
Shock troops.

187
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:55,054
Oh, that is a good one.

188
00:15:55,054 --> 00:15:57,222
If we go back in blind,
we'll be slaughtered.

189
00:15:57,423 --> 00:15:59,191
Or was there a patch down there?

190
00:15:59,191 --> 00:16:01,460
More like the living dead than people.

191
00:16:01,460 --> 00:16:04,530
Whoever's running this operation
hates us as much as they do the GALANTI.

192
00:16:04,930 --> 00:16:08,100
And as for the shock troops. Yes.

193
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:09,935
That part of the plan is already underway.

194
00:16:09,935 --> 00:16:11,570
No idea who these people are.

195
00:16:11,570 --> 00:16:14,073
They might even be someone
from the future.

196
00:16:14,873 --> 00:16:18,277
Hitched a ride like me.

197
00:16:18,277 --> 00:16:19,611
Is that what the Clancy showed you?

198
00:16:19,611 --> 00:16:21,880
Like I said, not particularly coherent.

199
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:24,450
Anyway, penance will work on weapons.

200
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:25,551
No, not weapons.

201
00:16:25,551 --> 00:16:27,653
Nonviolent objects of confusion
and defense.

202
00:16:27,653 --> 00:16:30,222
And I will continue
drawing up our rescue strategy.

203
00:16:30,255 --> 00:16:32,191
You do have resources here, you know.

204
00:16:33,258 --> 00:16:35,394
What will the alien do when it come out?

205
00:16:35,427 --> 00:16:37,363
What it was supposed to do
in the first place.

206
00:16:37,363 --> 00:16:38,464
Unite humanity.

207
00:16:38,464 --> 00:16:40,666
Oh, that sounds nice and easy. Look.

208
00:16:40,666 --> 00:16:43,035
Best case
scenario, it's going to save the world.

209
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:44,603
Which were

210
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,540
you said save the world?

211
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:49,675
That's right.

212
00:16:49,842 --> 00:16:52,111
Because I don't know about any future

213
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:57,316
of the world outside
this place is on fire.

214
00:16:57,383 --> 00:16:59,451
He said best case scenario.
What's worst case?

215
00:16:59,451 --> 00:17:00,219
It turns the world.

216
00:17:00,219 --> 00:17:46,932
Apart and we all die. Why?

217
00:17:50,202 --> 00:17:51,136
What's going on?

218
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:53,172
I don't know.

219
00:17:53,472 --> 00:17:56,175
What happened. What was the target thing?

220
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,911
It said flashbacks.

221
00:17:58,911 --> 00:18:01,580
I thought they started.
We came and didn't.

222
00:18:01,580 --> 00:18:02,648
Didn't everything go forward?

223
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:03,816
Instant Stanley?

224
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:06,318
Not anyway.

225
00:18:06,318 --> 00:18:12,458
Wasn't the same as before, though.

226
00:18:12,458 --> 00:18:14,493
I sort myself out. All on your own.

227
00:18:15,294 --> 00:18:18,130
Just like always, huh?

228
00:18:18,363 --> 00:18:18,964
My reaction

229
00:18:22,067 --> 00:18:22,868
was, Oh,

230
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:24,269
okay.

231
00:18:25,871 --> 00:18:27,106
I've heard the soldiers before.

232
00:18:27,106 --> 00:18:32,010
Look at me.

233
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:34,012
But an exhaustion doesn't go away.

234
00:18:34,012 --> 00:18:35,481
I ignored.

235
00:18:35,481 --> 00:18:36,281
My experience.

236
00:18:36,281 --> 00:18:39,751
That's exactly how it goes away.

237
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:42,254
I know what I mean. Now you know what?
You want to leave him.

238
00:18:42,621 --> 00:18:47,192
You have no idea

239
00:18:47,493 --> 00:18:49,661
what.

240
00:18:51,296 --> 00:18:53,599
Oh, sorry to interrupt.

241
00:18:54,500 --> 00:18:56,201
Look,
I've done the fucking meeting that we.

242
00:18:56,201 --> 00:19:19,625
Please start.

243
00:19:19,625 --> 00:19:22,861
Fuck,

244
00:19:22,861 --> 00:19:25,531
Tidy up and never leave the things
and the people.

245
00:19:26,732 --> 00:19:30,135
No, not that 16th century fucking Dell.

246
00:19:30,936 --> 00:19:32,404
Jesus Woogie.

247
00:19:32,404 --> 00:19:34,806
You got. This place is an absolute state.

248
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,943
Lucky that I'm here to help them.

249
00:19:37,943 --> 00:19:40,045
No, I prefer not to look at it.

250
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:40,379
Does that.

251
00:19:40,379 --> 00:19:41,547
Thank you very much.

252
00:19:41,547 --> 00:19:44,283
That the river well sorted out.

253
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:45,450
This is.

254
00:19:45,517 --> 00:19:48,353
So. I very much doubt you actually remove
my name from those papers.

255
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:49,321
Don't worry.

256
00:19:49,321 --> 00:19:50,656
Pretty little head about all.

257
00:19:50,656 --> 00:19:53,192
That very much in the. Process. Oh, Jesus.

258
00:19:53,392 --> 00:19:54,993
Then I've got a bleeding.

259
00:19:54,993 --> 00:19:57,462
Ear and a fractured rift. You've been

260
00:19:58,697 --> 00:20:02,401
sleeping.

261
00:20:02,601 --> 00:20:03,402
What?

262
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,238
Tell me everything.

263
00:20:06,672 --> 00:20:07,973
Actually, that is one.

264
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:09,841
Here I am.

265
00:20:09,841 --> 00:20:14,012
Oh, I do need to tell you something.

266
00:20:14,179 --> 00:20:18,550
And I'm only telling you
because I'm really,

267
00:20:18,550 --> 00:20:20,852
you know, my best friend and I.

268
00:20:22,754 --> 00:20:24,523
So who.

269
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,091
Have you met somebody?

270
00:20:26,792 --> 00:20:28,560
Yes, actually,

271
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:31,029
I suppose that is part of it was. Is.

272
00:20:31,129 --> 00:20:32,130
I wouldn't want to say.

273
00:20:32,130 --> 00:20:34,766
Oh, secretly delicious.

274
00:20:34,766 --> 00:20:36,368
That you have some advice.

275
00:20:36,368 --> 00:20:39,171
So what went wrong?

276
00:20:40,405 --> 00:20:42,140
Well. Well, I know what I would say.

277
00:20:42,140 --> 00:20:42,908
Yes, please.

278
00:20:42,908 --> 00:20:45,210
I would say

279
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:47,613
maybe. Woman, I am.

280
00:20:47,713 --> 00:20:48,547
August has been live.

281
00:20:48,547 --> 00:20:51,683
Yes, I am a man in my own right.

282
00:20:51,717 --> 00:20:54,486
A man with a with a bleeding ear and a.

283
00:20:54,486 --> 00:20:56,455
Fractured with a fighting man.

284
00:20:56,455 --> 00:20:57,823
Independent, brave.

285
00:20:57,823 --> 00:21:03,061
Choosing whichever path to adventure
I damn well one.

286
00:21:03,061 --> 00:21:05,097
Of course. You mustn't say any of that.

287
00:21:05,097 --> 00:21:06,898
Oh. Oh, yes. There.

288
00:21:06,898 --> 00:21:11,937
No, he just be your real charming,
awkward self.

289
00:21:11,937 --> 00:21:14,606
Who ask? Well,
that's. That's. That's just it.

290
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:20,078
You listen my real self.

291
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,882
I was trying to

292
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,818
please do something
about these fucking channels.

293
00:21:27,185 --> 00:21:29,354
There must be some sort of minister
or something.

294
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:32,658
Somehow I struggle
to see the cream of London decided

295
00:21:32,791 --> 00:21:33,859
to burn out for the sacking.

296
00:21:33,859 --> 00:21:36,061
Honorable, It's a big trip for next to a.

297
00:21:36,528 --> 00:21:37,829
Fucking chamber, Pops.

298
00:21:37,829 --> 00:21:40,832
Bull. No, no,

299
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,634
I really don't think the hell's the time.

300
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,038
And actually, as the
the official proprietor.

301
00:21:46,038 --> 00:21:49,141
If yesterday's grotesque
events have taught me anything, it is

302
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,710
a London needs a fucking party.

303
00:21:52,311 --> 00:21:53,445
So it's right with you.

304
00:21:53,445 --> 00:21:55,080
Orgy might intend to throw a festival.

305
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,015
So extraordinary, so transcendent.

306
00:21:57,015 --> 00:21:59,885
It will pass into legend
and all this gossip.

307
00:21:59,985 --> 00:22:02,654
This will be obliterated. Erased.

308
00:22:02,654 --> 00:22:05,290
You do realize that

309
00:22:05,357 --> 00:22:07,959
the ceremonies
is just a sex club for rich people?

310
00:22:08,527 --> 00:22:10,696
It is not just a sex club.

311
00:22:10,962 --> 00:22:53,472
It is a fucking phenomenal.

312
00:22:53,472 --> 00:22:55,941
Mrs. Beecham should have told you
this door is to remain.

313
00:22:55,941 --> 00:22:58,276
Sorry, my Lord, I. I didn't. Intend to

314
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:39,251
apologize for the.

315
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:44,856
Maid First. I.

316
00:23:44,856 --> 00:23:49,795
It's time to go shooting
with all of London up in arms.

317
00:23:49,795 --> 00:23:53,432
Last bit of pheasant
you brought back, though.

318
00:23:53,432 --> 00:23:56,802
Tell Roberts to take that horse
to the lower field. Mr..

319
00:23:56,868 --> 00:23:59,171
His horse always been a spirited creature.

320
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:01,540
I think it can sense the tremors.

321
00:24:01,540 --> 00:24:04,443
If I was a superstitious woman,
I'd say they were a sign

322
00:24:04,443 --> 00:24:09,815
of something.

323
00:24:09,815 --> 00:24:13,919
Messages from the heavens.

324
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:16,421
I'd have thought by now

325
00:24:16,421 --> 00:24:19,758
you would have realized that
if there is a God,

326
00:24:20,826 --> 00:24:22,527
he's an Englishman.

327
00:24:22,527 --> 00:24:24,930
He has no interest in declaring

328
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:33,772
his intentions.

329
00:24:33,772 --> 00:24:37,375
He'll come back for you.

330
00:24:37,609 --> 00:24:40,846
The fucking late night free time
checking aloneness.

331
00:24:41,813 --> 00:24:48,186
Since when do you ever throw in the towel?

332
00:24:48,186 --> 00:24:51,957
Fuck you, Opportunists.

333
00:24:51,957 --> 00:24:54,159
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. What did you say.

334
00:24:55,160 --> 00:24:56,628
To. Me?

335
00:24:56,628 --> 00:25:11,243
All right,

336
00:25:11,243 --> 00:25:12,511
I had.

337
00:25:46,645 --> 00:25:48,980
You scribbling away for

338
00:25:49,247 --> 00:25:50,048
nimble jokes.

339
00:25:50,048 --> 00:25:53,351
Tales of the touched newspapermen
going to be given their

340
00:25:53,351 --> 00:25:56,922
it to these cities on fire,
and you're spinning stories.

341
00:25:57,322 --> 00:25:59,991
Someone should only role model
for a touch kid

342
00:25:59,991 --> 00:26:02,994
on the street is humanity.

343
00:26:02,994 --> 00:26:09,000
I'd rather they out of fire wielding
Amazonian princess.

344
00:26:09,000 --> 00:26:11,069
Is that what you think my family's from?

345
00:26:11,069 --> 00:26:13,471
Why would she kill herself? So Melody

346
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:18,209
and all those people she took with her,
was it cause swell and hypocrite.

347
00:26:18,209 --> 00:26:20,912
So why did you work for her?

348
00:26:22,213 --> 00:26:23,715
Let's start with that.

349
00:26:23,915 --> 00:26:25,183
Well,

350
00:26:25,917 --> 00:26:27,852
there was the money.

351
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:29,721
Nah, I don't know.

352
00:26:29,721 --> 00:26:32,057
She just had something about

353
00:26:32,057 --> 00:26:33,124
the end of the day.

354
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:35,694
We were just puppets very, you know,

355
00:26:35,694 --> 00:26:38,229
wind up toys with the time.

356
00:26:38,229 --> 00:26:40,999
My kind of later.

357
00:26:40,999 --> 00:26:43,668
Is that what you came
here for, then? A leader.

358
00:26:44,736 --> 00:26:47,739
Don't strike me as the following time.

359
00:26:47,739 --> 00:26:58,483
I'm just passing through.

360
00:26:58,483 --> 00:27:02,621
I never like to stay away from.

361
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:07,192
Would do this to a movie.

362
00:27:07,192 --> 00:27:08,093
Who could do this?

363
00:27:08,093 --> 00:27:09,661
That's what I want to know.

364
00:27:09,661 --> 00:27:10,595
Look at him.

365
00:27:10,895 --> 00:27:12,897
Time that's been taken. The design.

366
00:27:12,897 --> 00:27:15,333
I just hope the artists left
some kind of signature.

367
00:27:16,134 --> 00:27:18,803
Could be the first step towards whoever's
got the calamity under armed guard.

368
00:27:18,937 --> 00:27:21,239
Jimmy here can get some justice
for what was done to him.

369
00:27:21,773 --> 00:27:24,643
Jimmy.

370
00:27:24,643 --> 00:27:26,544
After my Uncle Jim, what happened to.

371
00:27:26,544 --> 00:27:34,285
You know, Look, I'm just missing.

372
00:27:34,285 --> 00:27:36,888
How does that replaces the nervous system?

373
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:41,793
I thought to be electrical with a circle
of charge to make the last so long.

374
00:27:42,794 --> 00:27:45,130
Nice to see you enjoying your work.

375
00:27:45,130 --> 00:27:47,465
Oh, no, no,

376
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:49,200
it is horrible. I just

377
00:27:50,435 --> 00:27:52,203
never seen this kind of science before.

378
00:27:52,203 --> 00:27:53,838
This isn't science.

379
00:27:53,838 --> 00:28:13,958
This is evil.

380
00:28:13,958 --> 00:28:20,865
What's that?

381
00:28:20,865 --> 00:28:22,033
Was that connected to?

382
00:28:22,033 --> 00:28:24,302
I think that the nerves, not the wiring.

383
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:30,575
It looks like some sort of casing.

384
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:31,743
It's that.

385
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:34,512
Just thump.

386
00:28:35,013 --> 00:28:37,015
Oh, yes.

387
00:28:37,015 --> 00:28:37,916
The letters

388
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,585
Chinese

389
00:28:41,219 --> 00:28:43,521
ten Penfield Clockmaker.

390
00:28:43,922 --> 00:28:45,690
You need to come with us.

391
00:28:45,690 --> 00:28:48,393
No trouble in Limehouse
these days. We're all ready for trouble.

392
00:28:48,393 --> 00:28:50,061
Mrs. Czerny, please to.

393
00:28:50,061 --> 00:28:52,530
I only speak a few words of Chinese badly.

394
00:28:53,431 --> 00:28:55,700
I know.

395
00:28:55,700 --> 00:28:58,436
Not that, but in.

396
00:28:58,436 --> 00:28:59,704
My opinion, that.

397
00:28:59,704 --> 00:29:02,073
It's trespassing.
So today I want to go out.

398
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:04,209
Well, children are let go.

399
00:29:04,209 --> 00:29:05,944
Sugar Catholics.

400
00:29:05,944 --> 00:29:06,811
You go.

401
00:29:12,817 --> 00:29:30,668
From high to.

402
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:38,109
Malia.

403
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:38,409
Oh, no.

404
00:29:38,409 --> 00:29:44,249
We'll be walking targets
like they're wearing those.

405
00:29:44,249 --> 00:29:47,218
Mrs. True and I,
we were on a bit of a mission, so.

406
00:29:47,318 --> 00:29:48,052
I'm going

407
00:29:52,824 --> 00:29:57,295
on about about that with the the cave.

408
00:29:57,328 --> 00:30:00,431
And I wanted to apologize have

409
00:30:02,534 --> 00:30:03,301
and also

410
00:30:03,601 --> 00:30:06,671
also not have not apologize actually,

411
00:30:06,671 --> 00:30:09,541
because I'm I'm my own man.

412
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:12,443
I'm I'm a fighter and I'm a

413
00:30:16,080 --> 00:30:18,416
I just I'm going to pull them
full of pollen.

414
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:24,422
I'm going to follow my own path,
whatever way that takes me.

415
00:30:24,422 --> 00:30:27,659
Amalia. What? Just wait.

416
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:28,860
Citizens

417
00:30:29,427 --> 00:30:31,329
embarrassing.

418
00:30:45,043 --> 00:30:50,081
To tell you what, though,
all this focus on the glancy.

419
00:30:50,648 --> 00:30:52,350
There's no one out there anymore.
Doing what?

420
00:30:52,350 --> 00:30:54,219
Mrs. True And Lucy, you still.

421
00:30:54,219 --> 00:30:56,321
Looking out for the likes of us?

422
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:57,956
Who knows? There's more.

423
00:30:57,956 --> 00:32:25,677
Don't envy them today.

424
00:32:25,677 --> 00:32:31,616
My friends

425
00:32:31,616 --> 00:32:35,453
blessed me, Made me
Brother used to come here when he was.

426
00:32:35,453 --> 00:32:36,754
Scott was

427
00:32:37,655 --> 00:32:40,024
big around find Also.

428
00:32:41,726 --> 00:32:43,394
I never knew you had a family.

429
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,964
What do you think?
I just walked up here one day.

430
00:32:47,832 --> 00:32:50,835
Perhaps I like gloomy at work and

431
00:32:52,003 --> 00:32:54,839
thought the way of the summoning rain.

432
00:32:54,839 --> 00:32:55,907
That woman,

433
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:00,178
every boy or that journalist among

434
00:33:00,178 --> 00:33:02,246
you was in the station.

435
00:33:02,246 --> 00:33:03,581
She was out.

436
00:33:03,581 --> 00:33:08,987
He was laughing again, whispering,
You're jealous.

437
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,123
Did you know every man before?

438
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,625
Have What's she saying to you?
What did she say?

439
00:33:15,059 --> 00:33:15,727
Let me see.

440
00:33:15,727 --> 00:33:19,330
She said that
she thought you wasted in your job.

441
00:33:19,430 --> 00:33:20,164
You said that?

442
00:33:20,164 --> 00:33:23,935
She said that the longer you spend that
rotten police force of yours, the further

443
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:28,172
you off from ever being a man
you're meant to be.

444
00:33:28,172 --> 00:33:38,049
Carmine, Is not that,
you know, thing about you.

445
00:33:38,182 --> 00:33:40,351
Well,
I sense that you're going to tell me.

446
00:33:40,418 --> 00:33:42,453
Yeah.

447
00:33:42,453 --> 00:33:44,155
The thing about you

448
00:33:44,522 --> 00:33:47,492
is you got to own the bluebloods,

449
00:33:47,792 --> 00:33:53,131
the money, the parties that you wear it
well, but I think underneath

450
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:58,269
you despise it.

451
00:33:58,269 --> 00:34:02,106
I don't think you want none of it.

452
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:03,841
And I suppose

453
00:34:04,342 --> 00:34:08,780
you're going to tell me what it is
that I want, not.

454
00:34:08,780 --> 00:34:14,852
Not our Colonel Kleinman.

455
00:34:14,852 --> 00:34:16,120
I wonder

456
00:34:18,156 --> 00:34:21,092
if we go.

457
00:34:21,092 --> 00:34:23,561
I know that

458
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:29,801
will not get me in your little club.

459
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:37,775
Get me some of that charm.

460
00:34:37,775 --> 00:34:44,248
She saw her.

461
00:34:44,248 --> 00:34:46,217
She told me

462
00:34:46,517 --> 00:34:49,754
to keep an eye on you.

463
00:34:49,754 --> 00:34:59,797
Whether you like it or not.

464
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:34,765
Everybody needs a friend, Frank.

465
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:41,873
I do.

466
00:35:41,873 --> 00:36:16,073
What?

467
00:36:16,073 --> 00:36:19,410
Ordinarily, a guest waits
for an invitation before paying a visit.

468
00:36:19,677 --> 00:36:20,945
Perhaps you should tell that to Mrs.

469
00:36:20,945 --> 00:36:22,413
Amalia. True.

470
00:36:22,413 --> 00:36:25,016
After all, I didn't invite her
to our little excavation site.

471
00:36:25,016 --> 00:36:25,716
Did you?

472
00:36:25,716 --> 00:36:26,284
And your dance?

473
00:36:26,284 --> 00:36:28,052
You came all the same.

474
00:36:28,052 --> 00:36:29,253
This is true.

475
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,422
What was she doing?

476
00:36:31,422 --> 00:36:35,793
Talking to the creature, apparently
decapitating a few of my guards.

477
00:36:36,260 --> 00:36:38,162
The thing. The communicating.

478
00:36:38,162 --> 00:36:39,931
I think she upset it.

479
00:36:39,931 --> 00:36:41,799
All these earthquakes.

480
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:46,037
You think the monster is responsible
for the tremors?

481
00:36:46,037 --> 00:36:49,140
Is there any way that she could have
discovered my involvement?

482
00:36:49,674 --> 00:36:51,209
Anything in the case? Think.

483
00:36:51,209 --> 00:36:53,578
You know, it's been raised before,
but I question Mrs.

484
00:36:53,578 --> 00:36:56,380
True's credentials.
She doesn't seem like a baker to me.

485
00:36:56,380 --> 00:37:01,219
And I'm beginning to wonder if your two
little projects may no longer be quite

486
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:03,821
compatible.

487
00:37:04,055 --> 00:37:08,259
Rehabilitate has always been designed
to go hand in hand with a cure.

488
00:37:08,526 --> 00:37:12,663
But what if society were to find out
about our sideline,

489
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,100
our little cerebral

490
00:37:17,935 --> 00:37:19,604
forays?

491
00:37:19,770 --> 00:37:21,839
Medical breakthroughs have always

492
00:37:21,839 --> 00:37:24,976
required human trials.

493
00:37:24,976 --> 00:37:27,912
I will take care of Amalia. True.

494
00:37:27,912 --> 00:37:31,649
And when the creature is dead,
she and her kind will all be released

495
00:37:31,649 --> 00:37:33,150
from that purgatorial affliction.

496
00:37:33,150 --> 00:37:36,420
Well, truthfully, if it's even taken
form in there, we don't know

497
00:37:36,420 --> 00:37:40,691
quite what effect killing
the creature might have.

498
00:37:40,691 --> 00:37:45,363
Our doubts are traitors, are they not?

499
00:37:45,363 --> 00:37:49,333
But with you beside me,

500
00:37:50,401 --> 00:37:51,769
Lavinia,

501
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:56,741
I find I the resolve itself.

502
00:38:06,083 --> 00:38:06,717
Much farther to.

503
00:38:06,717 --> 00:38:07,618
The clockmaker.

504
00:38:07,618 --> 00:38:12,957
Not far.

505
00:38:12,957 --> 00:38:15,860
Okay. I didn't mean all that.

506
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,394
The cave.

507
00:38:16,394 --> 00:38:18,663
You know
you are allowed to make your own choices.

508
00:38:19,530 --> 00:38:21,932
I Just thought
if I could find the Clan of Faith

509
00:38:21,932 --> 00:38:25,036
and it might let you show me.

510
00:38:26,871 --> 00:38:29,340
Tell me what it turns out.

511
00:38:29,974 --> 00:38:33,878
The thought of wearing one of these things
a lot more frightening than going off

512
00:38:33,878 --> 00:38:40,384
to face
the might of Her Majesty's armed forces.

513
00:38:40,384 --> 00:38:42,820
Would you? Would you do the honors?

514
00:38:42,820 --> 00:38:45,156
You know, it's not the best day
to be wearing one of those things.

515
00:38:45,690 --> 00:38:46,991
It doesn't matter

516
00:39:07,111 --> 00:39:08,012
what's right.

517
00:39:08,446 --> 00:39:11,482
Sorry. Some

518
00:39:11,582 --> 00:39:14,452
the the birds today,

519
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:16,987
I think losing his erection.

520
00:39:16,987 --> 00:39:18,656
Because of the tremors.

521
00:39:18,656 --> 00:39:22,526
Something the bookseller's,
the witchcraft and powers.

522
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:25,796
Who These are an affront to God

523
00:39:25,796 --> 00:39:28,599
and he ever shall London
such songs of pleasure

524
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:32,470
tracking are very powerful with the stars.

525
00:39:32,470 --> 00:39:36,374
You have to travel

526
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,608
Shouldn't stay.

527
00:39:37,608 --> 00:39:40,544
Filling the streets with fire and blood.

528
00:39:41,979 --> 00:39:44,482
What about you, brothers and sisters?

529
00:39:45,149 --> 00:39:47,385
Will you not. Answer his call?

530
00:39:47,385 --> 00:39:51,555
Will you awaken to his love
for, you know, rise on young

531
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:53,758
love?

532
00:39:54,358 --> 00:39:55,559
That's what

533
00:39:56,627 --> 00:39:59,630
I'll fucking wait.

534
00:39:59,630 --> 00:40:12,276
Yeah.

535
00:40:12,276 --> 00:40:15,279
You've got a reckoning coming. I

536
00:40:21,352 --> 00:40:21,886
This is the piece

537
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:25,890
we found.

538
00:40:25,890 --> 00:40:27,658
You recognize it?

539
00:40:28,225 --> 00:40:31,162
It is a kissing
from one of our carriage clocks.

540
00:40:31,729 --> 00:40:34,465
That is a number in the mark

541
00:40:34,465 --> 00:40:38,102
of a foreign legion jingle on.

542
00:40:38,102 --> 00:40:41,372
We will find a buyer for you

543
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:56,053
in much trouble with these men.

544
00:40:56,053 --> 00:41:00,524
They say the city belongs to them.

545
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:04,895
None of the touch can stay in Chinatown
at the same time.

546
00:41:04,995 --> 00:41:05,830
The time

547
00:41:06,831 --> 00:41:10,501
someone is giving the purest names.

548
00:41:10,501 --> 00:41:45,002
You know,

549
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:50,808
for if.

550
00:41:52,743 --> 00:42:09,660
She's from the address.

551
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,962
That's the way

552
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:23,307
to. Get.

553
00:42:29,313 --> 00:42:29,813
Locked.

554
00:42:29,813 --> 00:42:32,249
You know the phrasing.

555
00:42:32,249 --> 00:42:34,385
She Italian? What's she saying?

556
00:42:34,385 --> 00:42:35,853
She's not Italian.

557
00:42:35,853 --> 00:42:37,721
She's touched to

558
00:42:38,188 --> 00:42:41,191
speak again.

559
00:42:41,191 --> 00:42:43,527
I What?

560
00:42:43,527 --> 00:42:46,997
I said speak for

561
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,008
my friends.

562
00:43:31,008 --> 00:43:33,410
It is. Because you, by God, touch.

563
00:43:34,244 --> 00:43:36,880
I know I've seen this. You.

564
00:43:36,880 --> 00:43:38,449
There's the curse on us.

565
00:43:38,449 --> 00:43:39,917
And you've taken you take it.

566
00:43:39,917 --> 00:44:19,189
You turn everything back there.

567
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:19,590
Come on.

568
00:44:21,125 --> 00:44:22,292
You offer to.

569
00:44:22,292 --> 00:45:39,803
Help. Now

570
00:45:41,972 --> 00:45:43,040
Wrath.

571
00:45:43,373 --> 00:45:44,975
You read me?

572
00:45:45,175 --> 00:47:38,222
Run life.

573
00:47:38,222 --> 00:47:41,225
What are you doing in your eyes?

574
00:47:41,291 --> 00:47:42,326
Fucking blinded me.

575
00:47:42,326 --> 00:47:45,796
You catch me in the unmentionable
vagina is not unmentionable Penance.

576
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:50,767
We've been through this before. Oh.

577
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:54,271
This is true.

578
00:47:55,172 --> 00:47:57,174
This is death.

579
00:47:57,174 --> 00:47:57,941
How did you get here?

580
00:47:57,941 --> 00:48:01,078
What dangerous does it matter?

581
00:48:01,478 --> 00:48:05,449
We put.

582
00:49:53,724 --> 00:49:54,725
Jimmy

583
00:50:05,635 --> 00:50:34,431
to hate.

584
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:38,435
Darling, Who is this?

585
00:50:39,770 --> 00:50:52,649
This your calling?

586
00:50:52,682 --> 00:50:54,851
Speak to.

587
00:50:55,652 --> 00:50:58,221
That accent.

588
00:50:58,221 --> 00:50:59,156
Am I wrong?

589
00:50:59,156 --> 00:51:01,525
It's Canadian.

590
00:51:01,525 --> 00:51:02,726
Originally,

591
00:51:03,827 --> 00:51:05,695
I like me.

592
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:09,032
How did you ever stop believing this was

593
00:51:12,969 --> 00:51:15,338
you on the street and fuck are you,

594
00:51:16,373 --> 00:51:17,340
my dear?

595
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:18,642
Did you think you were the.

596
00:51:18,642 --> 00:51:21,645
Only one who arranged a ride.

597
00:51:21,645 --> 00:52:03,220
Hello?

598
00:52:03,220 --> 00:53:19,596
How was the coffee

599
00:53:51,928 --> 00:54:16,853
fire?

600
00:54:16,853 --> 00:54:20,056
Getting to my prayer
and the day of my trip.

601
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:24,261
Click on you for that.

602
00:54:24,261 --> 00:54:27,130
No, not the praying. In these.

603
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:33,003
Seems fine to me.

604
00:54:33,003 --> 00:54:35,272
Yeah, exactly. How.

605
00:54:35,705 --> 00:54:38,508
How big is the ocean? And over.

606
00:54:38,508 --> 00:54:41,611
Let me call you back.

607
00:54:41,611 --> 00:54:45,115
That's a really good question.

608
00:54:45,115 --> 00:54:49,819
Tell me if you had not.

609
00:54:49,819 --> 00:54:59,596
You ready?

610
00:54:59,596 --> 00:55:04,234
And this tax season,
we all have a lot going on.

611
00:55:04,834 --> 00:55:06,069
I can't, man.

612
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:08,638
Luckily, TaxACT has a free expert
help you need

613
00:55:09,239 --> 00:55:11,341
so you can get back to the things
that matter most.

614
00:55:11,641 --> 00:55:14,711
File for less and get more Tax Act
and see Marvel Studios, Ant-Man

615
00:55:14,711 --> 00:55:17,847
and the WASP Quantumania only in theaters.

616
00:55:17,847 --> 00:55:20,550
In Northeastern has empowered me to.

617
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:24,254
Make an impact in environmental policy,
even though I'm still in classes

618
00:55:24,254 --> 00:55:28,425
and haven't graduated yet at Northeastern,
my job isn't just to teach.

619
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:32,062
It's to connect our graduate students
to real opportunities.

620
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:34,431
I'm not only N.A., I'm an alumni.

621
00:55:35,098 --> 00:55:38,868
My connection to Northeastern
is oftentimes and often it would be a.

622
00:55:48,211 --> 00:55:50,280
Whatever your child's dreams may be.

623
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:52,515
Come on can help them come through.

624
00:55:52,515 --> 00:55:54,784
Our math and reading program works.

625
00:55:55,218 --> 00:55:55,819
Thanks to the.

626
00:55:55,819 --> 00:56:00,990
Power of practice, regular practice
delivers mastery and confidence

627
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:04,694
so your child can retire and achieve more.

628
00:56:05,161 --> 00:56:08,665
Encourage your child
to imagine the very brightest future

629
00:56:09,099 --> 00:56:36,292
and let human help make it happen.

630
00:56:36,292 --> 00:56:39,896
Why would you not tell me
about these rankings

631
00:56:52,442 --> 00:57:03,253
to come?

632
00:57:03,253 --> 00:57:08,925
I'm losing my fucking mind.

633
00:57:08,925 --> 00:57:20,003
I'm breaking up into little pieces.

634
00:57:20,003 --> 00:57:20,703
What have the L.A.

635
00:57:20,703 --> 00:57:21,471
Times out, Major?

636
00:57:21,471 --> 00:57:22,539
Disappear

637
00:57:27,444 --> 00:57:27,811
so far?

638
00:57:27,811 --> 00:57:30,213
Alexis Navy, you listen to me

639
00:57:32,615 --> 00:57:33,283
right now.

640
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,951
You have a name to our enemy.

641
00:57:34,951 --> 00:57:36,753
We have a strange old lady
from the future.

642
00:57:36,753 --> 00:57:38,221
On the other end of a telephone line.

643
00:57:38,221 --> 00:57:40,323
We have an alien under threat.

644
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:41,825
We have a mission to save the world.

645
00:57:41,825 --> 00:57:43,593
So I will not hear one more word from you

646
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:45,895
about disappearing
or breaking up or getting up.

647
00:57:45,895 --> 00:57:49,899
Do you want to stop me, soldier?

648
00:57:49,899 --> 00:58:51,528
Get on your fucking feet
and get back to work.

649
00:58:51,528 --> 00:58:51,728
Three

650
00:58:56,065 --> 00:59:08,011
to. Oh,

651
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:19,756
hello.

652
00:59:19,756 --> 00:59:25,094
Isn't going to stop.

653
00:59:25,094 --> 01:00:19,315
Oh, he will.

654
01:00:19,315 --> 01:00:24,988
Yes, I.

655
01:00:27,957 --> 01:00:28,257
Will.

656
01:00:28,257 --> 01:00:35,765
They done?

657
01:00:35,765 --> 01:01:35,458
We can't let you stand.

658
01:01:35,458 --> 01:01:38,027
Na, na na

659
01:01:40,029 --> 01:01:42,465
na na na

660
01:01:42,632 --> 01:01:48,438
na na na.

661
01:01:48,438 --> 01:01:49,205
Mother.

662
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:54,210
Oh, my lord.

663
01:01:54,210 --> 01:02:00,883
All along.

664
01:02:00,883 --> 01:03:57,433
Na you.
